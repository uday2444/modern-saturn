        content: "A\_web API\_is an\_application programming interface\_for either a\_web server\_or a\_web browser. It is a\_web development\_concept, usually limited to a\_web application's client-side (including any\_web frameworks\_being used), and thus usually does not include web server or browser implementation details such as\_SAPIs\_or APIs unless publicly accessible by a remote web application.\n\nA **Server-Side** web API is a programmatic interface consisting of one or more publicly exposed endpoints to a defined request-response message system, typically expressed in JSON or XML, which is exposed via the webâ€”most commonly by means of an HTTP-based web server. Mashups are web applications that combine the use of multiple server-side web APIs.Webhooks are server-side web APIs that take input as a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is designed to be used like a remote named pipe or a type of callback such that the server acts as a client to dereference the provided URI and trigger an event on another server which handles this event thus providing a type of peer-to-peer IPC.\n\nA **Client-Side** web API is a programmatic interface to extend functionality within a web browser or other HTTP client. Originally these were most commonly in the form of native plug-in browser extensions however most newer ones target standardized JavaScript bindings.\n\nThe Mozilla Foundation created their WebAPI specification which is designed to help replace native mobile applications with HTML5 applications.\n\nGoogle created their Native Client architecture which is designed to help replace insecure native plug-ins with secure native sandboxed extensions and applications. They have also made this portable by employing a modified LLVM AOT compiler.\n"
